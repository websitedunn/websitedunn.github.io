    	<h2> Hockey, The best sport known to man pt.3 </h2>

       <p> Over the years, time and time again I have found myself in leadership positions.As captain of the team, and now even as a coach a lot of people have their eyes on me. As a leader I have always found leading by exampple to be a good tactic, not just as a player but a human being as well. </p>
